# Function: clearUpdates()

> **clearUpdates**(): `void`

Clears all downloaded CodePush updates.

This is useful when switching to a different release channel which may have an older release than the current package.
Note: we donâ€™t recommend using this method in scenarios other than that (CodePush will call

## Returns

`void`
