# Function: clearUpdates()

> **clearUpdates**(): `void`

Defined in: [clearUpdates.ts:10](https://github.com/AppZung/react-native-code-push/blob/5f900017beec34f1e037ac881585c7f5fb00d5dd/src/clearUpdates.ts#L10)

Clears all downloaded CodePush updates.

This is useful when switching to a different release channel which may have an older release than the current package.
Note: we donâ€™t recommend using this method in scenarios other than that (CodePush will call
this method automatically when needed in other cases) as it could lead to unpredictable behavior.

## Returns

`void`
